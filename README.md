# Arduino-Snippets
Arduino Snippets to play around with.
Currently:
- SensorMoteRF: playing around with SensorMote from Kippkitts (changed raw data to real data, getting Xbee's ro receive, etc). It assumes you are using an Arduino Leonardo or other Arduino that has more hardware serial ports.  Currently in development!
